# SQL Project HR Analysis
## Introduction
This project involves analyzing HR data to uncover insights about employee distribution, salaries, job titles, and trends over time. Using PostgreSQL, I executed several SQL queries to answer key questions regarding the HR dataset.

## Background
The goal of this project is to leverage SQL queries to gain a better understanding of various HR metrics. By analyzing employee data, salary distributions, department compositions, and trends over time, this project provides actionable insights for HR management.

## SQL Queries Addressed
### 1. Top 10 Employees with the Highest Salaries
To find the top earners within the company, I queried the data to list the top 10 employees based on their salaries.
```sql
SELECT
    emp.id,
    emp.first_name,
    emp.last_name,
    sal.salary
FROM
    employees AS emp
INNER JOIN salaries AS sal ON emp.id = sal.employee_id
ORDER BY
    sal.salary DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
| ID   | First Name   | Last Name  | Salary (Rs) |
|------|--------------|------------|-------------|
| 1406 | John         | Miller     | 99985       |
| 799  | Jane         | Lee        | 99968       |
| 1661 | John         | Brown      | 99922       |
| 1230 | Christopher  | Lee        | 99915       |
| 95   | Sophia       | Doe        | 99907       |
| 482  | Olivia       | Brown      | 99878       |
| 1241 | Daniel       | Johnson    | 99854       |
| 771  | Robert       | Lee        | 99809       |
| 502  | Emily        | Brown      | 99802       |
| 1103 | Michael      | Hall       | 99735       |

### 2. Employee Distribution by Department
To understand how employees are distributed across different departments, I calculated the employee count for each department.
```sql
SELECT
    dep.name,
    COUNT(emp.id) AS employees_count
FROM
    departments AS dep
INNER JOIN employees AS emp ON dep.id = emp.department_id
GROUP BY dep.name
ORDER BY COUNT(emp.id) DESC;
```
| Department                | Count |
|---------------------------|-------|
| Sales                     | 219   |
| Legal                     | 215   |
| Human Resources           | 210   |
| Customer Service          | 206   |
| Finance                   | 203   |
| Research and Development  | 200   |
| Marketing                 | 197   |
| IT                        | 187   |
| Administration            | 184   |
| Operations                | 179   |

### 3. Average Salary by Department
This query calculates the average salary for each department to identify departments with higher average compensation.
```sql
SELECT
    dep.name,
    ROUND(AVG(sal.salary), 0) AS avg_salary
FROM
    departments AS dep
INNER JOIN employees AS emp ON emp.department_id = dep.id
INNER JOIN salaries AS sal ON sal.employee_id = emp.id
GROUP BY dep.name
ORDER BY AVG(sal.salary) DESC;
```
| Department                | Avg Salary (Rs) |
|---------------------------|-----------------|
| Marketing                 | 76494           |
| Research and Development  | 76457           |
| Sales                     | 76171           |
| IT                        | 76090           |
| Customer Service          | 75044           |
| Operations                | 75034           |
| Legal                     | 74841           |
| Finance                   | 74412           |
| Human Resources           | 74342           |
| Administration            | 72407           |

### 4. Employees with Multiple Salaries
To identify employees who have been assigned multiple salaries, I used this query.
```sql
SELECT
    emp.id,
    emp.first_name,
    emp.last_name,
    sal.salary
FROM
    employees AS emp
INNER JOIN salaries AS sal ON emp.id = sal.employee_id
WHERE emp.id IN (
    SELECT employee_id
    FROM salaries
    GROUP BY employee_id
    HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
);
```
| ID  | First Name   | Last Name  | Salary (Rs) |
|-----|--------------|------------|-------------|
| 1   | Samantha     | Miller     | 60000       |
| 1   | Samantha     | Miller     | 54693       |
| 20  | Christopher  | Smith      | 55000       |
| 20  | Christopher  | Smith      | 50699       |
| 54  | Robert       | Smith      | 70000       |
| 54  | Robert       | Smith      | 67251       |

### 5. Employee Count by Job Title
This query provides the count of employees for each job title to understand job distribution within the company.
```sql
SELECT
    ti.name,
    COUNT(emp.id) AS employee_by_dep
FROM
    titles AS ti
INNER JOIN employees AS emp ON ti.id = emp.title_id
GROUP BY ti.name
ORDER BY COUNT(emp.id) DESC;
```
| Job Title          | Emp by Dept |
|--------------------|-------------|
| IT Consultant      | 216         |
| QA Tester          | 209         |
| UI/UX Designer     | 204         |
| Software Engineer  | 203         |
| Project Manager    | 200         |
| Network Engineer   | 200         |
| Business Analyst   | 197         |
| Database Admin     | 196         |
| System Analyst     | 195         |
| Data Analyst       | 180         |

### 6. Average Salary by Job Title
To find out which job titles have the highest average salaries, I calculated the average salary for each job title.
```sql
SELECT t.name, ROUND(AVG(sal.salary), 0) AS avg_salary
FROM titles AS t
INNER JOIN employees AS emp ON t.id = emp.title_id
INNER JOIN salaries AS sal ON emp.id = sal.employee_id
GROUP BY t.name
ORDER BY AVG(sal.salary) DESC;
```
| Job Title          | Avg Salary (Rs) |
|--------------------|-----------------|
| Network Engineer   | 76731           |
| System Analyst     | 76050           |
| Data Analyst       | 75315           |
| UI/UX Designer     | 75157           |
| Database Admin     | 74921           | 
| Software Engineer  | 74848           |
| IT Consultant      | 74772           |
| QA Tester          | 74707           |
| Business Analyst   | 74685           |
| Project Manager    | 74354           |

### 7. Salary Trends Over Time
To analyze how salaries have changed over time, I examined the average salary for each year.
```sql
SELECT
    EXTRACT(YEAR FROM start_date) AS start_year,
    ROUND(AVG(salary), 0) AS avg_salary
FROM
    salaries
GROUP BY start_year
ORDER BY start_year;
```
| Start Year | Avg Salary (Rs) |
|------------|-----------------|
| 2018       | 76224           |
| 2019       | 76387           |
| 2020       | 75804           |
| 2021       | 74341           |
| 2022       | 74334           |
| 2023       | 74601           |

### 8. Identify Departments with Above-Average Salaries (Using CTE)
This query uses a CTE (Common Table Expression) to first calculate the average salary across all departments, then compares each departmentâ€™s average salary against the overall average. This helps quickly identify which departments are paying above market average.
```sql
WITH overall_avg AS (
    SELECT ROUND(AVG(sal.salary), 0) AS avg_salary
    FROM salaries AS sal
)
SELECT
    dep.name,
    ROUND(AVG(sal.salary), 0) AS dept_avg_salary
FROM
    departments AS dep
INNER JOIN employees AS emp ON emp.department_id = dep.id
INNER JOIN salaries AS sal ON sal.employee_id = emp.id
GROUP BY dep.name
HAVING ROUND(AVG(sal.salary), 0) > (SELECT avg_salary FROM overall_avg)
ORDER BY dept_avg_salary DESC;
```
| Department               | Dept Avg Salary (Rs) |
| ------------------------ | -------------------- |
| Marketing                | 76494                |
| Research and Development | 76457                |
| Sales                    | 76171                |
| IT                       | 76090                |

### 9. Rank Employees by Salary Within Their Department (Using Window Function)
This query uses the RANK() window function to assign a rank to employees based on their salary within each department. This is useful to identify the top performers or highest earners per department.
```sql
SELECT 
    dep.name AS department,
    emp.first_name,
    emp.last_name,
    sal.salary,
    RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY dep.name ORDER BY sal.salary DESC) AS salary_rank
FROM
    employees AS emp
INNER JOIN salaries AS sal ON emp.id = sal.employee_id
INNER JOIN departments AS dep ON emp.department_id = dep.id
ORDER BY dep.name, salary_rank;
```
| Department | First Name | Last Name | Salary (Rs) | Salary Rank |
| ---------- | ---------- | --------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| IT         | John       | Miller    | 99985       | 1           |
| IT         | Emily      | Brown     | 99802       | 2           |
| IT         | Robert     | Lee       | 99809       | 3           |
| Sales      | Jane       | Lee       | 99968       | 1           |
| Sales      | Daniel     | Johnson   | 99854       | 2           |
